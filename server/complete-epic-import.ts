      title: "Complete Guide to Growing Heirloom Tomatoes from Seed",
      content: `<h1>Complete Guide to Growing Heirloom Tomatoes from Seed</h1>
      <p>Heirloom tomatoes offer unmatched flavor diversity and the satisfaction of growing varieties with rich histories.</p>
      
      <h2>What Makes a Tomato Heirloom?</h2>
      <p>Heirloom tomatoes are open-pollinated varieties that have been passed down through generations, typically 50+ years old. Unlike hybrids, they breed true to type, allowing you to save seeds.</p>
      
      <h2>Top Heirloom Varieties to Grow</h2>
      
      <h3>Cherokee Purple</h3>
      <p>This Tennessee heirloom produces large, purple-red beefsteaks with incredible smoky flavor. Plants are indeterminate and can reach 6-9 feet tall.</p>
      
      <h3>Brandywine</h3>
      <p>The gold standard of heirloom tomatoes. Large pink fruits with perfect sweet-acid balance. Amish variety dating to 1885.</p>
      
      <h3>San Marzano</h3>
      <p>Italian paste tomato with sweet, low-acid flavor. Perfect for sauces and canning. Look for authentic San Marzano Nano varieties.</p>
      
      <h2>Starting from Seed</h2>
      <p>Start seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost. Use quality seed starting mix and maintain 70-80¬∞F soil temperature for optimal germination.</p>
      
      <h2>Transplanting and Care</h2>
      <p>Transplant after soil reaches 60¬∞F consistently. Provide strong support - most heirlooms are indeterminate. Water consistently to prevent cracking.</p>
      
      <h2>Saving Seeds</h2>
      <p>Save seeds from your best fruits. Ferment tomato gel for 3-5 days, then wash and dry seeds thoroughly. Store in cool, dry conditions.</p>`,

      title: "Raised Garden Bed Construction: Cedar vs Metal Complete Comparison",
      content: `<h1>Raised Garden Bed Construction: Cedar vs Metal Complete Comparison</h1>
      <p>Choosing between cedar and metal raised beds impacts your garden's longevity, cost, and growing environment.</p>
      
      <h2>Cedar Raised Beds</h2>
      
      <h3>Advantages</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Natural rot resistance from cedar oils</li>
      <li>Excellent insulation properties moderate soil temperature</li>
      <li>Easy to modify and customize</li>
      <li>Attractive natural appearance ages gracefully</li>
      <li>No concerns about soil pH changes</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Considerations</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Higher upfront cost than pressure-treated lumber</li>
      <li>Will weather to silvery-gray without treatment</li>
      <li>May need replacement after 10-15 years</li>
      <li>Can be damaged by aggressive weed trimming</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Metal Raised Beds</h2>
      
      <h3>Advantages</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Extremely durable - can last 20+ years</li>
      <li>Modern, clean aesthetic</li>
      <li>No rotting, warping, or pest issues</li>
      <li>Quick assembly with modular systems</li>
      <li>Recyclable at end of life</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Considerations</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Can heat up quickly in direct sun</li>
      <li>May require soil buffer in very hot climates</li>
      <li>Limited customization options</li>
      <li>Potential for minor soil pH changes over time</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Cost Analysis</h2>
      <p>Cedar: $200-400 for 4x8 bed, Metal: $150-300 for 4x8 bed. Factor in longevity for true cost comparison.</p>
      
      <h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
      <p>For most gardeners, cedar offers the best balance of plant health, aesthetics, and workability. Choose metal for maximum longevity and minimal maintenance in moderate climates.</p>`,

      title: "Professional Seed Starting Setup: Equipment and Techniques",
      content: `<h1>Professional Seed Starting Setup: Equipment and Techniques</h1>
      <p>Creating a professional seed starting setup ensures consistent germination and strong transplants for your garden.</p>
      
      <h2>Essential Equipment</h2>
      
      <h3>Seed Starting Trays</h3>
      <p>Use 72-cell trays for most vegetables. Choose trays with drainage holes and consider biodegradable options for easy transplanting.</p>
      
      <h3>Growing Medium</h3>
      <p>Never use garden soil. High-quality seed starting mix provides proper drainage while retaining moisture. Look for mixes with perlite and peat or coconut coir.</p>
      
      <h3>Heat Mats</h3>
      <p>Bottom heat accelerates germination. Maintain 70-75¬∞F soil temperature for most vegetables. Use thermostatic controls for consistency.</p>
      
      <h3>Grow Lights</h3>
      <p>LED lights offer energy efficiency and full spectrum output. Position 6-12 inches above seedlings and provide 14-16 hours daily.</p>
      
      <h2>Professional Techniques</h2>
      
      <h3>Proper Planting Depth</h3>
      <p>Plant seeds 2-3 times their diameter deep. Fine seeds like lettuce need light to germinate - barely cover or surface sow.</p>
      
      <h3>Moisture Management</h3>
      <p>Bottom watering prevents disturbing seeds. Use humidity domes until germination, then remove to prevent damping off.</p>
      
      <h3>Fertilizing Seedlings</h3>
      <p>Begin liquid fertilizing at quarter strength when true leaves appear. Increase to half strength as plants develop.</p>
      
      <h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
      
      <h3>Damping Off</h3>
      <p>Caused by fungi in overly moist conditions. Ensure good air circulation and avoid overwatering.</p>
      
      <h3>Leggy Seedlings</h3>
      <p>Indicates insufficient light. Lower lights or increase duration. Gentle air circulation strengthens stems.</p>
      
      <h3>Poor Germination</h3>
      <p>Check seed viability, soil temperature, and moisture levels. Old seeds may have reduced germination rates.</p>
      
      <p>With proper equipment and techniques, you'll produce professional-quality transplants for a successful garden.</p>`,

      <h2>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles</h2>
      
      <h3>Prevention First</h3>
      <p>Healthy plants resist pests better. Ensure proper spacing, nutrition, and watering. Choose resistant varieties when available.</p>
      
      <h3>Monitor Regularly</h3>
      <p>Weekly garden inspections catch problems early. Look for eggs, larvae, and damage patterns. Keep a garden journal to track patterns.</p>
      
      <h3>Beneficial Insects</h3>
      <p>Encourage natural predators with diverse plantings. Ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps control many garden pests.</p>

      <h3>Aphids</h3>
      <p>Treatment: Insecticidal soap, neem oil, or strong water spray. Prevention: Attract ladybugs with yarrow and dill.</p>
      
      <h3>Cabbage Worms</h3>
      <p>Treatment: Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) spray. Prevention: Row covers during butterfly activity. Hand-picking effective for small gardens.</p>
      
      <h3>Squash Bugs</h3>
      <p>Treatment: Remove egg clusters, trap adults under boards. Prevention: Companion plant with nasturtiums and radishes.</p>
      
      <h3>Tomato Hornworms</h3>
      <p>Treatment: Hand-picking most effective. Look for white cocoons - these indicate beneficial parasitic wasps at work.</p>
      
      <h2>Organic Treatment Options</h2>
      
      <h3>Insecticidal Soap</h3>
      <p>Effective against soft-bodied insects. Apply in early morning or evening to avoid leaf burn. Reapply after rain.</p>
      
      <h3>Neem Oil</h3>
      <p>Systemic action disrupts insect growth cycles. Apply every 7-10 days. Avoid use during bloom to protect pollinators.</p>
      
      <h3>Diatomaceous Earth</h3>
      <p>Food-grade DE damages soft-bodied pests. Apply dry for crawling insects. Reapply after watering or rain.</p>
      
      <h2>Companion Planting for Pest Control</h2>
      <p>Marigolds deter many pests, basil repels flies and mosquitoes, and nasturtiums trap aphids and cucumber beetles.</p>
      
      <p>Successful organic pest control requires patience and observation, but results in a healthier garden ecosystem.</p>`,

      content: `<h1>Soil Health and Testing: Building the Foundation of Your Garden</h1>
      <p>Healthy soil is the foundation of productive gardening. Understanding and improving your soil creates the basis for thriving plants.</p>
      
      <h2>Understanding Soil Composition</h2>
      
      <h3>Soil Texture</h3>
      <p>Ideal garden soil contains 40% sand, 40% silt, and 20% clay. This loamy texture provides good drainage while retaining nutrients and moisture.</p>
      
      <h3>Soil Structure</h3>
      <p>Well-structured soil has aggregates that create pore spaces for air and water movement. Organic matter acts as the glue holding aggregates together.</p>
      
      <h3>Soil pH</h3>
      <p>Most vegetables prefer pH 6.0-7.0. Acidic soils (below 6.0) limit nutrient availability, while alkaline soils (above 7.5) can cause deficiencies.</p>
      
      <h2>Soil Testing Methods</h2>
      
      <h3>Professional Soil Tests</h3>
      <p>Extension service tests provide comprehensive nutrient analysis, pH, and organic matter content. Test every 2-3 years or when problems arise.</p>
      
      <h3>Home Test Kits</h3>
      <p>Quick pH and NPK tests give basic information. Less accurate than professional tests but useful for frequent monitoring.</p>
      
      <h3>DIY Tests</h3>
      <p>Jar test reveals soil texture. Squeeze test indicates clay content. Percolation test measures drainage rate.</p>
      
      <h2>Soil Amendments</h2>
      
      <h3>Organic Matter</h3>
      <p>Compost improves any soil type. Add 2-4 inches annually and work into top 6-8 inches. Well-aged manure provides similar benefits.</p>
      
      <h3>pH Adjustment</h3>
      <p>Limestone raises pH gradually. Sulfur lowers pH slowly. Wood ash raises pH quickly but use sparingly.</p>
      
      <h3>Drainage Improvement</h3>
      <p>Coarse sand and perlite improve drainage in heavy clay. Avoid fine sand which can create concrete-like conditions.</p>
      
      <h2>Building Soil Biology</h2>
      
      <h3>Beneficial Microorganisms</h3>
      <p>Mycorrhizal fungi extend root systems. Beneficial bacteria fix nitrogen and suppress diseases. Avoid broad-spectrum fungicides.</p>
      
      <h3>Earthworms</h3>
      <p>Earthworm castings improve soil structure and fertility. Encourage worms with organic mulch and avoiding soil disturbance.</p>
      
      <h2>Long-term Soil Management</h2>
      <p>Minimize tillage to preserve soil structure. Use cover crops in unused beds. Rotate crops to prevent nutrient depletion and disease buildup.</p>
      
      <p>Investing in soil health pays dividends in plant performance, pest resistance, and reduced need for external inputs.</p>`,
