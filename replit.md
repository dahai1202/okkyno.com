The application provides a modern, responsive shopping experience with features including product catalog management, user authentication, shopping cart functionality, blog system, and admin dashboard.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and modern development practices
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: React Context API for global state (Auth, Cart, Search) combined with TanStack Query for server state management
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for robust form management

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication (prepared for Passport.js integration)
- **API Design**: RESTful API with structured error handling and validation

### Build System
- **Bundler**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support across frontend and backend
- **Development**: Hot module replacement and fast refresh in development

## Key Components

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components make API calls through TanStack Query
2. **API Layer**: Express.js routes handle requests with validation
3. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM manages PostgreSQL interactions
4. **Response Processing**: Data is formatted and returned to client
5. **State Management**: TanStack Query caches and synchronizes server state
6. **UI Updates**: React components re-render based on state changes

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits login credentials
2. Server validates against database
3. Session cookie is set for authenticated users
4. Protected routes check authentication status
5. User context provides authentication state to components

### Shopping Cart Flow
1. Cart items are stored with session ID
2. Local storage maintains session persistence
3. Cart operations sync with backend API
4. Real-time updates across components via React Context
